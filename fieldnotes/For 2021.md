# Technologies To Look at Durring 2021

## Carp Lang
Staticly Compiled LISP? Are you serious. That would be amazing. Looks young and understaffed though...

## DataLog
Logic programming language for crunching data without explaining "how" to crunch data. Parallel ready. Woah?

## PureScript
FP Language, that compiles to C,C++(11),Go(?why?), JS(ew). Writes like Haskell?!

## Zig
Some better version of C or something.

## Unison
https://www.unisonweb.org/docs/quickstart/
FP programming language. Looks cool.

## Janet Lang
A somewhat stable dynamic LISP angled for application development?
