List of technologies I'll try to look at for 2021

## PureScript
FP Language, that compiles to C,C++(11),Go(?why?), JS(ew). Writes like Haskell?!

## DataLog
Logic programming language for crunching data without explaining "how" to crunch data. Parallel ready. Woah?

## Unison
https://www.unisonweb.org/docs/quickstart/
FP programming language. Looks cool.
